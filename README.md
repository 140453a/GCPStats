# GCPStats

This program pulls the Glass Cannon Podcast running time off of an RSS feed and visualizes individual episode times, the average time, and a moving average over 8 episodes in a line graph using Pandas.

This was made for a Reddit post at: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGlassCannonPodcast/comments/bh7yzc/heres_a_bar_graph_of_all_gcp_episodes_and_their/

### Examples
### (Updated) Regular graph
The graph has been updated to lump together "multi-part" episodes. For example, Episode 200 Parts 1, 2, 3 as suggested in the top Reddit comment. Additionally, labeling has been fixed.
